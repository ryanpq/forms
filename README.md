Various tools for skinning and improving forms

##tweet_preview.js
This script takes a form input field (usually text) and a div as input and will watch the form field for changes.  When a change is detected the script will check if the content is a valid twitter url leading to a tweet and use twitter's existing tools to replace the div content with the tweet specified.

This tool is designed to allow visual validation for a form requesting the URL for a tweet by providing a real-time preview of the content.
